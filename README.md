# Guns O' Plenty
An Ultrakill mod that adds a staggering 2.5 weapons into the game!

## Installation
If using r2modman, simply click the install button.

If installing manually, extract the mod's zip in the plugin folder. Make sure you aslo have [PluginConfigurator](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/EternalsTeam/PluginConfigurator/) installed as the mod depends on it.

If everything's installed properly you should see a pop-up in the main menu saying the mod successfully loaded. If you do not see a pop-up or the pop-up says it failed to load the mod, then you may have installed it incorrectly.

## How To Use
In the Plugin Config menu, you can enable/disable the guns you want to use as well as what slots they should be in.
